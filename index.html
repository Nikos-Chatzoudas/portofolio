    <p>
      I am a passionate student at the University of Thessaly in the department of Digital Systems in Greece, driven by
      a deep love for computer science. My knowledge encompasses a wide range of programming languages. Through engaging
      in numerous hands-on projects, I have honed my skills in various domains such as web development, software
      solutions, and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a project. I'm always excited to
